## Features

* **Customizable:** You don't need to be an expert to customize AdminKit. Our code is very readable and well documented.
* **Fully Responsive:** With mobile, tablet & desktop support it doesn't matter what device you're using. AdminKit is responsive in all browsers.
* **Cross-Browser:** Our themes are working perfectly with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge. We're working hard to support them.
* **Clean Code:** We strictly follow Bootstrap's guidelines to make your integration as easy as possible. All code is handwritten.
* **No jQuery:** AdminKit, and all third-party libraries used in the admin template, do not require jQuery as a dependency.
* **Regular Updates:** From time to time you'll receive an update containing new components, improvements, and bugfixes.
